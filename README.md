<h2>Problem Setting</h2>
<p>Some would say that razor-sharp analytical skills and creativity do not go hand-in-hand, but we disagree. We know there are plenty of programmers out there who can come up with fun problems for our contests.</p>
<p>We need problems for both our <a href="#LongContestSetting">Long Contests</a> and our <a href="#CookOffContestSetting">Cook-Offs</a>. Read on for specifications and submission rules.</p>

<h3>Problems Setting Rules</h3>
</div>
<ol>
<li>We do not accept unsolicited problems. To become an official CodeChef Problem Setter, go <a href="#getStarted">here</a>. </li>
<br />
<li>The problems should be "Chef"-ified :-). What this means is that is will be good to build the problem statement around a story that has Chef in it. It is desired but not mandatory. </li>
<br />
<li>For every problem you submit, you must provide:                                             									                                                        
<ul>
<br />
<li>The problem statement. Please find the suggestions and template for writing a problem statement <a href="/wiki/problem-statement-template">here</a>.</li>
<br />
<li>The solution with appropriate comments for understanding. This is mandatory and should be submitted while submitting the problem. </li>
<br />
<li>Test Data           
<ul>
<li>Test cases - A set of input files and expected output files.</li>
<li>The test generation plan. Find the guidelines for creating a test generation plan <a href="/wiki/test-generation-plan">here</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<br />
<li>The difficulty level of the problem, which will be verified and approved by both the Problem Tester and a CodeChef Admin. Refer <a href="#difficultLevels"> Difficulty Levels</a>.</li>
<br />
<li>A write up and inputs regarding the problems to the <a href="#editorials">Editorialist</a> for making the editorials.</li>
<p><b>If you do not provide all 5 of these requirements, your problem will not be considered!</b></p>
<p><b><br /></b></p>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If we accept any of your problems, you must be available during the contest to resolve any issues pertaining to any of your problems. </li>
<br />
<li>If we accept any of your problems, you must also answer the questions or any queries pertaining to the problems that you have set after the end of the contest on the problem discussion forum. Most of the questions are asked till 1-2 weeks after the contest ends.</li>
<br />
<li>No cheating! You are not allowed to participate in a contest that includes any of your problems. Also, you are not allowed to share any information about your problems or answers with anyone.                                      
<ul>
<br />
<li>We're serious. Before we can review any of your problems, we require that you sign a <a href="/download/Directi-Mutual-NDA.docx">Non-Disclosure Agreement</a> saying that you won't cheat. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<br />
<li>No plagiarism. If we find you simply substituting names or numbers from other problems, we will not accept your problem. </li>
<br />
<li>You are not allowed to share your submitted problems elsewhere without our prior consent.</li>

<li>For every problem set you write the Editorials for, the guidelines for the Editorilas are as under:<br /> 
<ul>
<br />
<li>Editorial must be in <a href="http://discuss.codechef.com/markdown_help/">wiki markdown</a>.</li>
<br />
<li>Editorial should be in simple, easy to understand English Language.</li>
<br />
<li>There should be links to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_picture_is_worth_a_thousand_words"> pictures </a> or references required to explain the concept. You may send us pictures to upload on our server, if you want to use them in the editorials.</li>
<br />
<li>Editorial should contain a very detailed explanation of the solution. The level of detail should be such that a newbie should be able to get guidance on learning those concepts required to solve the problem, provided that he or she invests sufficient time and effort into it.</li>
<br />
<li>Editorial should have an explanation on the approaches/concept/algorithm/technique of both the setter's and the tester's solutions. Any additional links/reference must be given.</li>
<br />
<li>Editorial should contain discussion of alternate approaches of solving the same problem.</li>
<br />
<li>Editorial may contain discussion of a few variants of the same problem. For example, some interestings variants of the problem that were found during testing process could be provided.</li>
<br />
<li>Please find some more tips to write Editorials and the Editorial Template <a href="/wiki/editorial-template">here</a>.</li>
<li> You must not miss on reading a very <a href="http://discuss.codechef.com/questions/19313/what-makes-a-good-codechef-editorial" target="_blank">awesome write up</a> on '<b>How to make a a good editorial</b>' by <a href="/users/pragrame" target="_blank">Pradeep George Mathias</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<br />
<li>You must verify that the solution for all the problems provided by setter and tester should be commented for better understanding.</li>
<br />
<li>It is encouraged that you also write your own solution strictly following the editorial. This ensures that the editorial explains all necessary tricks.</li>
<br />
<li>It is expected that you will also monitor and answer the Questions/Doubts asked in editorial forum by the participants. Most of the questions are asked till 1-2 weeks after the contest ends.</li>

<h3>Long Contest Problems</h3>
</div>
<p>We use six different types of problems of varying difficulty in our Long Contests:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>1 CAKEWALK</b>: The problem should be solved by someone who knows any programming language and basic data structures like arrays and lists. No further knowledge should be considered mandatory to solve these problems. Example: <a href="/FEB12/problems/MAXCOUNT">MAXCOUNT.</a> </li>
<br />
<li><b>2 SIMPLE</b>: These may or may not require some algorithms but whatever is required should be immediately obvious from statement, similar solution idea should be easily available in any text book, easily searchable, and more importantly should be very easily implementable. Almost zero genius is required. Example: <a href="/FEB12/problems/LUCKY5">LUCKY5</a> and <a href="/FEB12/problems/WCOUNT">WCOUNT</a>.</li>
<br />
<li><b>2 EASY</b>: This should be fairly easy for most of the contestants to solve this problem without too many optimizations. A novice programmer should be able to solve it within his/her knowledge of programming. May not require knowledge of advanced data structures. Example: <a href="/JAN12/problems/RHOUSE">RHOUSE</a> and <a href="/FEB12/problems/LUCKY1">LUCKY1.</a></li>
<br />
<li><b>2 MEDIUM</b>: These problems should require some more work for anyone to solve them. Advanced programming concepts like DP, Graphs, Trees or Mathematics etc, may be needed to solve them. May also require knowledge of advanced data structures. However it should not involve looking into research papers for the problems to be solved. Not easy to make. A novice programmer should not be able to solve them without putting in lot of effort. Example: <a href="/FEB12/problems/BBSYSTEM">BBSYSTEM</a> and <a href="/FEB12/problems/CYDB">CYDB.</a></li>
<br />
<li><b>2 HARD</b>: These are the hardest to make. They should be able to challenge the best programmers out there for a 10 day contest. The idea to solve should be hard to come up with even with the knowledge of most advanced algorithms. Often, Problem Setters have made use of problems in research to get ideas regarding such problems. Example: <a href="/FEB12/problems/FLYDIST">FLYDIST</a>, <a href="/NOV11/problems/DOMNOCUT">DOMNOCUT</a>, <a href="/JAN11/problems/WINDOW">WINDOW</a>, <a href="/DEC11/problems/SHORT2">SHORT2</a> and <a href="/DEC11/problems/HYPER">HYPER</a>.</li>
<br />
<li><b>1 CHALLENGE</b>: All the above problems are binary problems (Either they give a full score of 1 or none 0). They are typically optimization problems (maximize or minimize). The best submission gets a score of 1 while the rest get scores relative to the points of the best submission. The difficulty of getting an accepted solution on the challenge problem should not exceed "Medium". Ideally it should lie between "easy" to "medium". Example: <a href="/FEB11/problems/THREECLR">THREECLR</a>, <a href="/MARCH11/problems/ALLINONE">ALLINONE</a>, <a href="/MAY11/problems/BICKER">BICKER</a>, <a href="/JUNE11/problems/CAVE">CAVE</a> and <a href="/APRIL11/problems/L2GRAPH">L2GRAPH</a>.</li>
<br /> 
</ul>

<div>
<h3>Cook-Off Problems</h3>
</div>
<p>We use five different types of problems of varying difficulty in our Cook-Off competitions:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>1 CAKEWALK</b>: Should be very straight forward. This should be solvable by everyone who comes to the site and who knows how to write code. No further knowledge should be considered mandatory to solve these problems. This is primarily put up to encourage new comers by giving them some gratification of solving a problem in a contest and make them try again and improve.</li>
<br />
<li><b>1 SIMPLE</b>: Not as straight forward as CAKEWALK. May not involve advanced concepts like Dynamic programming. Not a very tight bound optimization problem. This should be solvable by everyone who knows basic data-structures and programming.</li>
<br />
<li><b>1 EASY</b>: More difficult than the previous one. May involve slightly advanced data-structures and algorithms. It may require slightly more advanced concepts of data structures and algorithms, like DP, Graphs, Trees or Mathematics etc. Should be solvable by roughly 40%-50% of the contestants.</li>
<br />
<li><b>1 EASY-MEDIUM</b>: Needless to say, more difficult than the previous one. Should be solvable by only the good programmers. May involve advanced programming concepts and may be complicated to code. Only very serious programmers should be able to solve it.</li>
<br />
<li><b>1 MEDIUM-HARD</b>: It is fine if no one is able to solve it during the contest. This should challenge even the best programmer out there. Ideally only one or two people should be able to solve this problem in the given time. But this should not be a problem which requires going through a research paper. Even the top programmers should sweat it out to solve in the given 2.5 hours.</li>

<p>For payment processing we have the following process:</p>
<ul>
<br />
<li>For payments within India:                                                        
<ul>
<br />
<li>We issue Cheques and mail the same to the provided Postal Address</li>
. <br />
<li>A Tax Deduction at Source @ 10% is done for every payment as per the Income Tax Guidelines under Section 194B. We issue a TDS certificate for the same at the end of the Financial year in which the payments are made.</li>
<br /> 
</ul>
</li>
<li>For payments outside India:                                                        
<ul>
<br />
<li>We transfer the amount via <a href="https://www.paypal.com/">PayPal</a>.</li>
<br />
<li>For countries that do not permit PayPal transactions, we transfer the amount via Wire Transfer.</li>
<br />
<li>For Wire Transfers, each transaction incurs an additional cost of 25 USD. This cost we bear at our end. However, to keep this affordable, for any wire transfer payments we will make payment only once in every 2 months subject to a minimum payment of 200 USD. However, if the person wants to bear this cost, we can make the payment immediately.</li>
<br />
<li>Payments will be normally done after the end of a contest. It usually takes us about a week to process the payments.</li>
<br />
<li>Advance payments for any problem will be done along with the payment cycle for the contest being held in that month.</li>

<p>Download the NDA from <a href="/download/Directi-Mutual-NDA.docx">here</a>. Sign it and send us the scanned copy of the same along with your mail.</p>
<p>In addition to all that, we want to you to send us a small assignment. Since problem setting requires good test data generation, this will involve making a test generator from a given test plan. You may read up on test plan generation <a href="/wiki/test-generation-plan">here</a>. All we need you to do is to create tests as well as the generator for the problem <a href="/problems/CAKEDOOM">CAKEDOOM</a> and send it to us along with your application.</p>
